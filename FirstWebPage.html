        <h1> This is my introduction</h1>
        <p><i>Hello my name is Saraa Yafai. Welcome to my first HTML WebPage. Sitback, grab some popcorns and enjoy and as I try to implement what I have just learned</i>
        </p>

        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p> I was born in <b>Yemen</b> on February 10<sup>th</sup>, 1996. I came to America in 2002, when I was about 6 years old. <br/>I graduated from <strong> <abbr title="City University of New York"> CUNY </abbr> Hunter College </strong> in 2019 with a <em>major</em> in <b>Human Biology</b> and a <em>minor</em> in <b>Psychology</b>
            <br>
            I did pre-health track in college because I wanted to work in the healthcare field, specificly, a Physician Associte. I worked as <abbr title="Emergency Medical Technician"> EMT </abbr> for three years. 
            One year during college and two years after graduation. Getting into a <appr title="Physician Associate" target="-blank"> PA </appr> school has become very competative. It took me at least three years because I had gain 
            experience and I had to boost up my appplication. In 2022, I finally got accepted to <a href=https://shs.touro.edu/programs/physician-assistant/physician-assistant-middletown target="-blank"> Touro College PA program </a>. It was up in Middletown, NY.
            Six months into the program, I realized that this was not the career I wanted to do for the rest of my life and thats when I dropped out. While I contemplated to finish the program and I may end up liking it. 
            My biggest fear was finishing the program after 28 months only for me to still not like it at the end. 
            <br>
        </p> 
        <p>
            Funny enough, I orginaly wanted to <em>major</em> in <b>Computer Science</b> because I had a bit of experience in <b>Java</b> back in <a href="https://www.madisonhs.org/"> James Madison Highschool</a>. 
            I wanted to continue because I enjoyed it. However, in college during my freshmen year I was met with one of the worst professors in computer science and thats when I decided to switch majors.
